But I try to remind myself that’s it’s normal to feel a bit of awkwardness and if I was in a different country where I’m still learning, and hopefully improving in the language, I would probably feel the same way as someone who is speaking English as a second or third language. So basically, I try to have more compassion, patience and try to make sure I understood most of what they said.;In the past, when working with other students with English as their second language, I have asked some people to repeat what they said, especially when I didn’t clearly understand some parts of what they said due to the accent being different. And I also try to speak slower, listen more to make sure I understood as much as I could. ;"Search Engine (e.g. Google search);Language learning apps;Online forums or community groups (e.g., Reddit, TripAdvisor forums);Social media platform;Translation apps (e.g. Google Translate, deep);";"Embarrassment;Anxiety;Curiosity;";Rarely
